**5 bullet points about my Chinese chef Cooker website project:**

- Frameworks & Libraries: The website is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The website also utilizes Express for handling JSON data, Tailwind CSS for responsive design on mobile devices, and Firebase Authentication for user authentication and authorization.

- User Registration & Authentication: Users can create accounts and log in securely using Firebase Authentication. This allows users to save their favorite recipes, leave comments, and interact with other users on the platform.

- Chef Profiles: The website features profiles of Chinese chefs, highlighting their specialties, experience, and culinary philosophies. Each chef profile includes a photo of the chef, their bio, and links to their social media profiles.

- Backend: The website uses Express as a backend to handle API requests and to manage and serve recipe data. Firebase Authentication is used for user authentication and authorization. This allows for secure user account creation and management, as well as secure storage and retrieval of user data, such as saved recipes and comments.

- Mobile Responsive Design: Tailwind CSS is used to ensure the website is mobile-responsive, meaning that the website is optimized for viewing on a range of mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets. This allows users to access the website and its content from anywhere, at any time.
