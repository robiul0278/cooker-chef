      Chef Academy students learn the art of cooking from a professional
      platform to gain experience in the field. We offer bespoke, practical and
      effective courses that focus not only on teaching the main cooking
      techniques, but also teach the meaning of what it is like to be a chef
      working in a professional kitchen. Our students have the chance to train
      alongside London's best chefs, from top level fine dining to Michelin star
      level, in the kitchens of their restaurants. They will be ready to start
      working immediately after the successful completion of the course. They
      will have all the practical and theoretical skills to confidently enter a
      professional kitchen. Chef Academy is a prestigious school that is
      internationally recognised. The Academy was founded in Italy and due to
      huge success, another school was opened shortly afterwards in London,
      which is amongst the most reputable in the UK. Graduating at Chef Academy
      will give you access to the professional world of cooking. Our school is
      also internationally recognized by ASIC (Accreditation Service for
      International Colleges).
